<h3>How to Backup FSIP</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ll need access to both your Web and database data to perform a complete backup of FSIP.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download your Web directory.</li>
<li>Download your database contents.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Download your Web directory</h5>

<p>Using an FTP, SFTP, WebDAV or other client, download your entire FSIP installation. For quicker backups, the essential files are 
<code>config.php</code>, <code>/extensions</code>, <code>/includes</code>, and <code>/themes</code>. 
Optionally, you may or may not want to backup <code>/images</code> (likely the largest directory) 
depending on whether you have copies of your images elsewhere.</p>

    <strong>Tip</strong>
    <p>If you have root access, compress your directory into an archive, and then download that archive. 
    The download will be much faster.</p>

    <p class="nm"><code>tar -c <em>your_directory</em> --exclude "images" > <em>your_archive</em>.tar</code></p>
</div>
