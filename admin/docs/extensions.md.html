<h3>Extensions and the Orbit Engine</h3>

<p>FSIP offers an extension engine that allows Web developers to add new functionality and share their creations with other FSIP users. Even if you don&#8217;t know how to program you can easily add new features by installing extensions.</p>

<h5>Installing Extensions</h5>

<p>You can install most themes by dragging an extension&#8217;s folder to your <code>/extensions/</code> folder, choosing <strong>Configuration > Extensions</strong>, and clicking Install Extensions. Check with the documentation that came with your extension if any further configuration is required; some extensions will not work if left unconfigured.</p>

<h5>Developing An Extension</h5>

<p><em>Warning: Experience with PHP and SQL is required to develop your own extension. You will only be able to create an extension as complex as your mastery of these programming languages.</em></p>
