<h3>Metadata (EXIF, IPTC, and Geolocation)</h3>

<p>By default, FSIP will automatically import all EXIF, IPTC, and geolocation metadata associated with your images when you process them in your <strong>Shoebox</strong>. You will be given a chance to augment, modify, or erase this data before you publish your photos. You can change this behavior by choosing <strong>Settings > Configuration</strong>.</p>

<h6>EXIF Data</h6>

<p>Most digital cameras automatically write EXIF data to your photo files. This data typically includes parameters such as the time and date the photo was taken and the exposure and aperture settings. More advanced cameras (or those with GPS attachments) may append latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>

<h6>IPTC Data</h6>

<p>Most applications including Aperture, Lightroom, Photoshop (as well as even basic ones such as Preview) allow you to create IPTC data. This data can include items such as a title, description, and city. You can also include keywords, which will be automatically imported as tags.</p>

<h6>Geolocation</h6>

<p>If any geolocation data is found during processing, FSIP will automatically use the best mix of EXIF and IPTC data (as well as its internal geographic database) to determine your image&#8217;s exact location, and assign it a city name, country name, latitude, and longitude.</p>
