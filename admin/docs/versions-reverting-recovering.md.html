<h3>Versions, Reverting, and Recovering</h3>

<p>FSIP includes multiple features to improve your CMS experience including versions, reverting, and recovering. Additionally, FSIP autosaves most content, so should you accidentally click a link or close your browser Window, your work (or a very recent version of it) is saved. You&#8217;ll automatically be notified when auto-saved material is available for recovery.</p>

<h5>Versions and Reverting</h5>

<p>FSIP automatically retains a copy of every page you publish when you save your changes. 
Version control allows you to review the changes between the current document and an older version.</p>

<p>Click &#8220;Compare to previous version&#8221; on any post or page to compare the differences. 
Once the differences are calculated and displayed, you can then copy and paste content you 
accidentally deleted back to the page you&#8217;re viewing.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll also be given an option to &#8220;Revert to previous version.&#8221; 
This will copy the older version you are reviewing into the text area. 
Please note: Any unsaved changes will not be retained.</p>

<h5>Recovering</h5>

<p>FSIP keeps copies of most types of content should you accidentally 
delete something or decide you want to restore that data later.</p>

<p>To restore an item you previously deleted, go to <strong>Settings</strong> and click &#8220;Enter recovery mode&#8221;. 
You can then browse and search deleted content through your Dashboard. 
Once you&#8217;ve found the item you&#8217;d like to restore, click the &#8220;Restore&#8221; checkbox on the item&#8217;s Dashboard page, and save those changes.</p>

<p>You can restore as many items as you wish. When you&#8217;re done, you should exit recovery 
mode by going to <strong>Settings</strong> and clicking &#8220;Exit recovery mode.&#8221; 
Your once-deleted items will now be amongst the rest of your content.</p>
