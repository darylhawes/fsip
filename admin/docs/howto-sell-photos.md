### How to Sell Your Photos

With FSIP selling your photos online can be easy. Since you run your own Web site, you have unrestricted freedom in choosing how to market your art. One easy way to get started is [Fotomoto](http://www.fotomoto.com/), which will handle the billing and production associated with marketing prints and related products of your photos.

###### 1. Register at Fotomoto

Go to [Fotomoto](http://www.fotomoto.com/) to sign-up. It costs nothing to join. When you're done, log-in to Fotomoto, and click the Settings tab. Save your "Store ID". You'll need it later.

###### 2. Configure the Fotomoto extension.

FSIP came with a Fotomoto extension. It is already installed in the `extensions/` folder on your Web site. Log-in to your FSIP Dashboard. Choose **Settings > Extensions > Fotomoto**. Copy your "Store ID" (from Fotomoto) and save the changes.

###### 3. Integrate Fotomoto with your Web site.

Unless you've heavily modified your FSIP installation, your image pages will be served by `image.html` of your current theme. Open the `image.html` template and try adding one of the Fotomoto Canvas tags such as `{Image_Fotomoto_Buy}`. Save your changes and upload the template. Go to your Web site and see the new link. Now your visitors can quickly and easily buy your prints.
