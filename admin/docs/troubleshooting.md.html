<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<h6>I can&#8217;t find the installation page, or I receive a &#8220;No database connection error.&#8221;</h6>

<ul>
<li>You must install FSIP before you can use it. The installation page is located in the <code>install/</code> directory. Read <a href="installation-and-updates.md.html">the included installation instructions</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure you&#8217;ve replaced your <code>config.php</code> when instructed to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h6>I can&#8217;t load the installation page.</h6>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your Web site is running PHP 5. Some Web hosts run PHP 4 by default, 
but almost all let you switch to PHP 5 through their control panels.</li>
<li>Make sure your Web host is compatible with FSIP by viewing your Compatibility Suite file (<a href="../../cs.php">cs.php</a>).</li>
<li><em>(Windows only)</em> Delete the <code>Web.config</code> file. It may cause 500-code errors 
where URL Rewrite 2 is not installed or your control panel is overriding certain settings.</li>
<li><em>(Windows only)</em> Make sure your Windows user account has full permissions to 
read and write the folders: <code>cache/</code>, <code>data/db/</code>, <code>data/images/</code>, <code>shoebox/</code>; 
you can do this through your Web host&#8217;s control panel.</li>
</ul>

<h6>I receive an error &#8220;Cannot use object of type FSIP as array&#8221;.</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>You have a non-standard PHP configuration. You need to turn off <code>register_globals</code> 
in your PHP configuration (<code>php.ini</code>). If you&#8217;re using the Apache HTTP Web server 
(as most do), you can add a <code>.htaccess</code> file with the following data to your base directory:</p>

<pre><code><IfModule mod_php5.c>
    php_flag register_globals Off
</IfModule></code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h6>I can&#8217;t modify the permissions on folders or files.</h6>

<ul>
<li>Some servers, such as those running suPHP, only need permissions set to <code>644</code> for files and <code>755</code> for folders. 
If you&#8217;re unsure, contact your Web hosting provider.</li>
<li><em>(Windows only)</em> You cannot change permissions using your FTP client. You must use your 
Web hosting provider&#8217;s control panel to edit permissions</li>
</ul>

<h6>I can load the installation page, but can&#8217;t get to the next step.</h6>

<ul>
<li>Double-check your database credentials (name, username, and password) are correct.</li>
<li>Some Web hosts have separate database servers. In this case, your Web host should have 
supplied you with a separate domain to access the database (for example, <code>mysql.yourwebhost.com</code>). 
Enter this domain in the &#8220;Database host&#8221; field on the installation page.

<ul>
<li>Also, some Web hosts also may not run their database server that allow access via standard ports. 
If your Web host supplied you with a port number (for example, <code>9000</code>), enter it in the &#8220;Database port&#8221; 
field on the installation page.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h6>I get alert dialog boxes from my Web browser that stop the page from loading, or some features aren&#8217;t working.</h6>

<ul>
<li>Update your Web browser. We strongly recommend <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Apple Safari</a>, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>, or 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> for use with the FSIP Dashboard. 
All of these support drag-and-drop uploading. If you&#8217;re using another Web browser, 
such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> consider deleting it and replacing with something more compatible.</li>
</ul>

<h6>I restored FSIP from a backup and now it doesn&#8217;t work.</h6>

<ul>
<li>Your session may be corrupt. Quit your Web browser, and reopen it.</li>
<li>Double-check your <code>config.php</code> file to ensure it contains your database credentials.</li>
<li>Double-check the appropriate directories have read and write permissions. 
(See <a href="installation-and-updates.md.html">&#8220;Installation and Updates.&#8221;</a>)</li>
</ul>
