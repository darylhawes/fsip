Choose a cluster of images by selecting the first image in the cluster and then, while holding down the Shift key on your keyboard, selecting the last image in the cluster. To determine the images shown in the Editor, choose the <strong>Library</strong>, perform a search, and then choose <strong>Bulk Editor</strong>.</p>
