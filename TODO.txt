Warnings and errors printed at the bottom of the page should have a setting for displaying to "admin" users only.
_______

Template update? add next image / previous image buttons to Image editor in admin area to the image preview in main index as well.

Rename "getIncludes" in fsip class to getThemeIncludes and rename config.php var INCLUDES to THEME_INCLUDES
create new theme_includes folder at the root and move the hello world bit there.
________



add FSIP test on construct to warn if memory below 128MB?
// Require at least 128M memory
$mem = ini_get('memory_limit');
if (substr($mem, -1) == 'M') {
	if (substr($mem, 0, strlen($mem) - 1) < 128) {
		if (!ini_set('memory_limit', '128M')) {

}

________

Create "editorial" rights set. Add "no rights reserved" and "editorial" as default rights to project.
add some rights into system. basic default should be royalty free rights, free purchase.
add editorials capabilities. mark a photo as one, search for them, rights/licensing associated bits, etc

Template mod: add dbase stats. Total number of images in database, total number of views by guests on an image, etc.

________

There is a user preference to "Display <x>  images per page." That's only for admin image views when adding data to uploaded files. That's not for the user template of viewing images that are in the system as a guest, etc. Check on or add that feature as a user preference as well.

_________
Javascript: after uploading a single file when you upload another the progress bar has not reset. it should clear and build again on second upload in a single upload.php session.
________

Search terms / filter should be displayed so you know what you're looking at.

It appears that the search filter may be saved in the session? There are issues working with multiple windows of the same browser for multiple tasks. If so - move it to _GET or _POST arguments!

_________

change index template pagination to match dashboard in admin page's results version

If the user is logged in and viewing the normal user template image page 
add a link to edit the image itself in user's dashboard.

________
admin page title should be FSIP Dashboard - SiteName or Untitled.
Similar to this check in comments.php:
	// Configuration: comm_enabled
	if (!$fsip->returnConf('comm_enabled')) {
		?>
		<p class="notice">New comments have been disabled. You can enabled comments in your <a href="<?php echo BASE . ADMIN . 'configuration' . URL_CAP; ?>">configuration</a>.</p><br />
		<?php
	}
provide a notice in admin dashboard if sitename is untitled to go to confiration page.

________

allow tags to be entered as space or comma separated multiples in a single line

insert a user preference for how many images to show per page.


convert fsip default image size on first index page. maybe check if num images over 1 then show smaller icons?

Allow users to create their own "lightboxes", playlists or collections of images they have bookmarked. Allow these to be shared easily.
________

Themes:
	- Find out why there is a <uid></uid> var in XML file. Can that be removed without breaking anything? There is already a folder/project name and a version and build number.
	- In install/index.php there is a manual load of a default theme ~line 234. Why not install all present themes at load time and then manually set the choice of default only? It seems that going on admin/themes does the check for extra themes and install. Shouldn't this be a regular check and notify the user that there are new themes ready to install, etc?
	//		$query = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO ' . $_POST['install_db_prefix'] . 'themes (theme_uid, theme_title, theme_build, theme_version, theme_folder, theme_creator_name, theme_creator_uri) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');
//		$query->execute(array('225b134b655901223d2f2ee26599b71763b1e5fe', 'P1', 1, '1.0', 'p1', 'Wilkes & Barre', 'http://www.wilkesandbarre.com/'));
		$query = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO ' . $_POST['install_db_prefix'] . 'themes (theme_uid, theme_title, theme_build, theme_version, theme_folder, theme_creator_name, theme_creator_uri) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');
		$query->execute(array('FSIP_DEFAULT', 'fsipDefault', 1, '0.1', 'fsipDefault', 'Daryl Hawes', 'http://fsip.sdelargy.com/'));

_______

Shoebox subfolders needed. 
Create a subfolder for the user's userid to upload into and process from. 
admin/shoebox.php likely to be the area where reading should be done and admin/upload.php as well.
-- In configuration there is the heirarchical option:
Images	 Enable hierarchical directory mode using   format 
Recommended for efficiently storing large image libraries, reorganize your image library after changing this setting
-- check into this. surely we can insert the userid parent folder in here.


________

--global setting check is returnConf('key')	if($fsip->returnConf('syndication_summary_only')){

in users and other places find code like $user_db['user_id'] != 1 which 
means userid of 1 is the first added user which is the superuser. replace with isAdmin($user_id) and isSuperUser($user_id) functions in FSIP class?
user_id of 1 should be user class of "super admin"

admin/users.php --

Create/verify "admin" user and "contributor" user and "guest" user classes.

add user class of "reviewer"

add user class of "contributor"

user class "guest" should only be able to browse images or login.

_______

When installing site configuration should be the first stop rather than dashboard.
_______


Add Publish button and date field similar to wp admin Add Post page!
	If NOT and ADMIN then "publish" should not be an option. "ACCEPT and PUBLISH" should be the admin action. "REJECT" should be another option and images rejected should remain in the system marked as rejected by admin.
________


add notification to admins when a new image is uploaded and ready to publish. 

add a button on the user's profile to allow them to "request publish" from admins on their images.



add support for model and building releases.

________

Upload progress bar does not reset to clear on second upload. Maybe redo it with a per file upload hover box that marks as completed like the file upload tool in cpanel?

Analytics plugin edit needed: Do not display analytics code if the logged in user is an admin. Add option for this feature in setup area.
________

Add plugin settings panes similar to vanilla forums? 

Adapt vanilla plugin user registration plugins for social network logins! (Cannot use vanilla forums code directly, it is GPLv3 licensed) (wordpress is GPL v2!)

Create user registration page. "login or register."
_________

add reviewer's comments field to image editing options.

add an admin moderation process for file submissions
________

Ensure that the user who uploaded the file and their profile settings are shown for every image displayed.
________

Fork codebase and rename project to FSIP - Free Stock Image Project?

Look for front page options. Just showing the large version of the latest upload is not good enough. It should appear more professional like the istockphoto or photodune.net sites appear.

Will need a project logo and mini icon for URL bar.

Add personal user profile fields to user record and in user preferences/settings area. Tumlr link, youtube, flickr, Facebook links.
________

What about the ability to publish an approved image with reviewers comments and model release references to a central database which could then inform an extended library (as an extension or option)?
________

When looking at your own images allow different views. Thumbnails, or list view with metadata on the side. Also allow users to reorder images at their leisure to manually sort their order.
________


When prompted to empty cache just do it, don't go to maintenance page where you hav eto dig through to find the option.

_________

Update rework.
	- When new updates are discovered tell admin and offer them a link to a new update.php admin page where the update would then be performed rather than performing updates every time there are files in the update folder on login.
	- Updates should be named by date and installed updates tracked in the db then ignored.
	- No need to rename or remove the updates folder moving forward.
	

________
Getty Images - filters for Royalty Free. Add sort/search/filter by rights option?
______
run phpdoc and process phpdoc output into docs/ folder?

________

List out all third party tools included and check their versions to see if any of them need updates. Add to bottom of README as "included third party code" or whatever.

 UPDATE from 1.0.3 to 1.1.1 - https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/Dropbox/blob/master/Dropbox.php
 http://classes.verkoyen.eu
 
______

Make a note on the geo text field of the format that is expected with/without the google map API extension activated.
(You do not have the google map API string <activated>. The format we expect in this field is long/lat ex. 00000 0000)
(You do have the google map API string <activated>. The format we expect in this field is a location string ex. London, England, UK)


Geo: research how geo is really supposed to work. How does the googlemaps extension work? What format should the location field be in and why won't it do a lookup for you?

See find class - 	public function location($geo='', $radius=50) 

- apparently wants either a string with a city name or a long/lat string.
surely there is a service that can be used to convert an arbitrary string into long/lat before loading it into the db? The cities and sountries db entries are lists of geo codes in /db/cities.json and db/countries.json

Also:
Integrate maps by adding the {Image_Map} Canvas tag to your {block:Image} loop.
