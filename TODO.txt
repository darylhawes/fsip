Admin - create an Alkaline export tool and an import-from-alkaline fsip tool.
Admin - create an upgrade tool for database upgrades.

ADMIN - MAINTENANCE
Add an admin task.php file to view the db/log.txt database transaction log
_______

// DEH TODO: in dashboard.php census instead of reporting only image #: 
	report publisher images # vs. total images in dbase, maybe also display #deleted images!
________
USER
Allow user to change their password and set preferences in user's own profile page.
Add more personal user profile fields to user record and in user preferences/settings area. 
Tumblr link, youtube links.
//create user_twitter, user_fb, user_flickr personal details options?
________
USER/THEME
Ensure that the user who uploaded the file and their profile settings are shown for every image displayed.
	Probably requires the $user overhaul to create new methods to get a user details from ID, etc.
_________
USER
If the user is logged in and viewing the normal user template image page 
	add a link to edit the image itself 
		(meta data, etc. Should be able to lock this info down as admin and require the user to make a request to edit it.)
	in user's dashboard 
		only if they are an admin or it is their image
_______
USER
Shoebox subfolders needed once $user new roles and methods added.
	Create a subfolder for the user's userid to upload into and process from. 
	admin/shoebox.php likely to be the area where reading should be done and admin/upload.php as well.

-- In configuration there is the heirarchical option:
	Images	 Enable hierarchical directory mode using   format 
	Recommended for efficiently storing large image libraries, reorganize your image library after changing this setting
	-- check into this. surely we can insert the userid parent folder in here.

________

Link in header to "my images" should not go to 
	admin/search (result) but user/search (result) instead.
________

When looking at your own images allow different views. 
	Thumbnails, or list view with metadata on the side. 
	Also allow users to reorder images at their leisure to manually sort their order.

_______
THEME
Look for front page options by adding a new theme or two with different front page appearances. 
Just showing the large version of the latest upload is not good enough. 
	It should appear more professional like our favourite stock sites appear.

________

THEME / TEMPLATE - fsipDefault
- add ability for users to send in suggestions for tags on images
- add ability for users to send in suggestions for alternate titles and descriptions on images
- add ability for users to send in requests for new images (challenges, work for hire)
- put pagination bar before and after images in results.php
_______
THEME
create new theme_includes folder at the root and move the hello world bit there. 
Also create per-theme php_includes folders and put a local hello world in there?
________
THEME
Theme: Add optional sidebar blocks? Can put tag cloud, most downloaded, etc there.
________
In dashboard.php census area: instead of reporting only image: #
	report publisher images # vs. total images in dbase, maybe also display #deleted images!
________
In configuration.php create sub-tabs inside the page. General (save settings), Storage(?) (save settings), Advanced (with Sphinx, etc) (save settings)
_______
add next image / previous image buttons in admin/image.php
add next image / previous image buttons to the image preview in /image.php.
________
INSTALL
Theme and install process:
	In install/index.php there is a manual load of a default theme ~line 234. 
	Why not install all present themes at load time and then manually set the choice of default only? 
	It seems that going on admin/themes does the check for extra themes and install. 

//		$query = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO ' . $_POST['install_db_prefix'] . 'themes (theme_uid, theme_title, theme_build, theme_version, theme_folder, theme_creator_name, theme_creator_uri) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');
//		$query->execute(array('225b134b655901223d2f2ee26599b71763b1e5fe', 'P1', 1, '1.0', 'p1', 'Wilkes & Barre', 'http://www.wilkesandbarre.com/'));
		$query = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO ' . $_POST['install_db_prefix'] . 'themes (theme_uid, theme_title, theme_build, theme_version, theme_folder, theme_creator_name, theme_creator_uri) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');
		$query->execute(array('FSIP_DEFAULT', 'fsipDefault', 1, '0.1', 'fsipDefault', 'Daryl Hawes', 'http://fsip.sdelargy.com/'));

Shouldn't this be a regular check and notify the user that there are new themes ready to install, etc?
_______

Add some default rights into system. The basic system default should be royalty free rights, free purchase.
Create "editorial" rights set. Add "no rights reserved" and "editorial" as rights to include by default with project initial download.
Add editorials capabilities. mark a photo as one, search for them, rights/licensing associated bits, etc

There is a user preference to "Display <x>  images per page." That's only for admin image views when adding data to uploaded files. 
	That's not for the user template of viewing images that are in the system as a guest, etc. 
	Check on or add that feature as a user preference as well.
________

Search terms / filter should be displayed so you know what filtered images you're looking at.

It appears that the search filter may be saved in the session variables? 
There are issues working with multiple windows of the same browser for multiple tasks. 
If so - move it to _GET or _POST arguments perhaps to make multi tab browsing work better!

________

allow tags to be entered as space or comma separated multiples in a single line. Vanilla tag addition format is cool, converting anything before a space into a luggage tag.

insert a user preference for how many images to show per page.

Allow users to create their own "lightboxes", playlists or collections of images they have bookmarked. Allow these to be shared easily.
________
THEME
Themes: Find out why there is a <uid></uid> var in XML file. Is it for the remote boomerang 3rd party extension version check stuff? Can that be removed without breaking anything? There is already a folder/project name and a version and build number.

________

Update system needs rework.
	- When new updates are discovered tell admin and offer them a link to a new update.php
	 	admin page where the update would then be performed rather than performing updates 
	 	every time there are files in the update folder on login.
	- Updates should be named by date and installed updates tracked in the db then ignored.
	- No need to rename or remove the updates folder moving forward.
________
INSTALL / UPDATE
After installing the site's configuration page should be the first stop rather than the site dashboard.
_______

USER / ADMIN
Add Publish button and date field similar to wp admin Add Post page!
	If user is NOT an ADMIN then "publish" should not be an option. "ACCEPT and PUBLISH" should be the admin action. 
	"REJECT" should be another option and images rejected should remain in the system marked as rejected by admin.
________

add notification to admins when a new image is uploaded and ready to publish. 

add a button on the user's profile to allow them to "request publish" from admins on their images?

add support for model and building releases.

________
TODO in Javascript? after uploading a single file when you upload another the progress bar has not reset. 
	-it should clear and build again on second upload in a single upload.php session.

Upload progress bar does not reset to clear on second upload. Maybe redo it with a per file 
	upload hover box that marks as completed like the file upload tool in cpanel?

________
Analytics plugin edit needed: Do not display analytics code if the logged in user is an admin. 
	Add option for this feature in setup area (create new plugin settings page in admin area).
________

Create new plugin user registration plugins for social network logins! 
	(various exist, be careful of licensing, look for BSD/MIT style licensing of these plugins)

Create user registration page. "login or register."

adapt vanilla tag autocomplete and css for photo tags. Perhaps use autosuggest javascript.
	http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin
_________
add an admin moderation process for file submissions
_________
add a reviewer comments field to image editing options.
________
Will need a project logo and mini icon for URL bar.

________
Filters for Royalty Free. Add sort/search/filter by rights option?
______

run phpdoc and process phpdoc output into docs/ folder when far enough along.

________

What about the ability to publish an approved image with reviewers comments and model 
	release references to a central database which could then inform an extended library 
	(as an extension or option)?

________

Add feature for "unlisted" images to work similar to youtube protected access - 
		if you know the URL then you have access.
_____

List out all third party tools included and check their versions to see if any of them need updates. 
	Add to bottom of README as "included third party code" or whatever.

 UPDATE from 1.0.3 to 1.1.1 - https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/Dropbox/blob/master/Dropbox.php
 http://classes.verkoyen.eu
 
______

Make a note on the geo text field of the format that is expected with/without the google map API extension activated.
(You do not have the google map API string <activated>. The format we expect in this field is long/lat ex. 00000 0000)
(You do have the google map API string <activated>. The format we expect in this field is a location string ex. London, England, UK)


Geo: research how geo is really supposed to work. How does the googlemaps extension work? What format should the location field be in and why won't it do a lookup for you?

See find class - 	public function location($geo='', $radius=50) 

- apparently wants either a string with a city name or a long/lat string.
surely there is a service that can be used to convert an arbitrary string into long/lat before loading it into the db? The cities and sountries db entries are lists of geo codes in /db/cities.json and db/countries.json

Also:
Integrate maps by adding the {Image_Map} Canvas tag to your {block:Image} loop.
