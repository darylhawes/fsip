Themes:
	- Find out why there is a <uid></uid> var in XML file. Can that be removed without breaking anything? There is already a folder/project name and a version and build number.
	- In install/index.php there is a manual load of a default theme ~line 234. Why not load all themes at load time and then manually set the choice of default only?
	//		$query = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO ' . $_POST['install_db_prefix'] . 'themes (theme_uid, theme_title, theme_build, theme_version, theme_folder, theme_creator_name, theme_creator_uri) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');
//		$query->execute(array('225b134b655901223d2f2ee26599b71763b1e5fe', 'P1', 1, '1.0', 'p1', 'Wilkes & Barre', 'http://www.wilkesandbarre.com/'));
		$query = $db->prepare('INSERT INTO ' . $_POST['install_db_prefix'] . 'themes (theme_uid, theme_title, theme_build, theme_version, theme_folder, theme_creator_name, theme_creator_uri) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);');
		$query->execute(array('FSIP_DEFAULT', 'fsipDefault', 1, '0.1', 'fsipDefault', 'Daryl Hawes', 'http://fsip.sdelargy.com/'));

Update rework.
	- When new updates are discovered tell admin and offer them a link to a new update.php admin page where the update would then be performed rather than performing updates every time there are files in the update folder on login.
	- Updates should be named by date and installed updates tracked in the db then ignored.
	- No need to rename or remove the updates folder moving forward.
