        <h1>FSIP</h1>

<p>Free Stock Image Project</p>

<p>Drag-and-drop uploading, automatic metadata retrieval, and deceptively simple theming are just the beginning. Based on Alkaline.</p>

<p>Alkaline was developed by <a href="http://www.budinltd.com/">Budin Ltd.</a> as a commercial PHP content management system from February 2011 to August 2012. It has since been discontinued, and is now available as open source software under the MIT license. A license is no longer required to use the application. You can learn more about Alkaline at <a href="http://www.alkalineapp.com/">alkalineapp.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Features &amp; Documentation</h2>

<p>See docs folder in your installation.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>PHP 5.2+ with modules: GD, JSON, PDO (with appropriate database driver), SimpleXML</li>
<li>A MySQL 5.x or PostgreSQL 8.x database, or SQLite 3.x support</li>
</ul><p>Unsure if your site is compatible? Use the <a href="/compatibility/">compatibility suite</a> to check your configuration automatically. The site admin installing FSIP should also have rudimentary knowledge of HTML and previous experience transferring files via FTP. Also, additional RAM may need to be allocated to PHP in order for FSIP to process very large images; your Web hosting provider should be able to do this for you if you're unable to do so on your own.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Download FSIP <a href="https://github.com/darylhawes/fsip">available for free on GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Unpack the archive (usually by double-clicking on it).</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use an FTP application to move the contents of the folder <code>fsip/</code> from your computer to your Web site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the permissions on the folders: <code>cache/</code>, <code>db/</code>, <code>images/</code>, and <code>shoebox/</code> to <code>0777</code> (read, write, and execute), also set the same permissions to the file <code>config.json</code>
</li>
<li>Delete the <code>update/</code> folder</li>
<li>
<em>Recommended:</em> Remove the included themes and extesions by deleting the folders within <code>extensions/</code> and <code>themes/</code> (except <code>themes/p1/</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Once you're done uploading the files visit the <code>install/</code> directory of your Web site where you installed Alkaline to complete your installation.</p></li>
</ol><h2>Support</h2>

<p>No support is offered for this product. "Swim at your own risk."</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Alkaline is no longer undergoing active development. At this time, no new features will be added, but I encourage users to submit reasonable pull requests that improve its compatibility or reliability.</p>
